# banking-system
The banking system is the software application for maintaining a personâ€™s account. This will be a Console based application. In this we will be using unordered maps and CSV files for storing and accessing the data. We are covering the basic functionality of a Bank Account like withdrawal of money and depositing money. We have an additional operation transfer of money from one account to another account. We have few more operations like displaying the details of the account, modifying the account details and deleting the account. The data is stored as comma separated values in files. To increase the efficiency of the program we will be using hash maps.
